I enjoyed working with others and learn from them. Take a look at some projects I made before:

#### 1. Modeling Hate Speech [View More](https://yushiqi1999.github.io/testblog/Modeling Hate Speech-Shiqi Yu.pdf)

With nowadays rapid development of the Internet and a strong support for free speech, negative online behaviors, such as toxic comments, appear frequently. All comments in our data set come from Wikipedia talk page edits and they have been labeled by human raters for toxic behavior. Our goal in this project is to create a model that is capable of detecting different types of toxicity.

#### 2. Making Better Rosters for a Better Cornell Experience [View More](https://yushiqi1999.github.io/testblog/Algorithm.pdf)

With the increasing enrollment at Cornell and the limited number of classrooms, the current roster may soon fail to satisfy the needs of students and professors. In this project, our goal is to improve the current classroom and lecture assignments by using optimization algorithms to quantify how much better rosters can be if we tweak current scheduling rules, while at the same time trying to solve scheduling conflicts and other possible problems that might come up.

#### 3. Statistical Learning for Wine Quality Prediction [View More](https://yushiqi1999.github.io/testblog/Statistical Learning for Wine Quality Prediction.pdf)

Vinho Verde is a unique product of the Minho region of Portugal. It has a moderate
alcohol content and is particularly appreciated for its freshness. The dataset contains various features for the attributes of wine, and the output variable is ordinal data(quality). Therefore, it can be used by public research for regression and classification tests. We have two types of wine in the dataset which are red wine and white wine. In this report, we are going to fit multiple regression and classification methods in this multi-class dataset and compare them.

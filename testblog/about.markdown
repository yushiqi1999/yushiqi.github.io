This is my fifth year studing in the US and I got my undergraduate degree from Wake Forest University in North Carolina. At Wake Forest University, I majored in Mathematical Statistics and minored in Psychology. My past experiences in dealing with statistical models and analyzing datasets drove me to continue studying ORIE at Cornell. My classmates and colleagues know me as a good team leader, a strong communicator, and an experienced programmer in both R and Python. I've always been passionate about building statistical models to extract useful information from big data. In the spare time, I'd love to watching movies, doing yoga, and cooking. Nice to meet you!
